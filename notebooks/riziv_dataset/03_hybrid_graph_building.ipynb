    "After building the base document graph and extracting relevant legal concepts for a sample of text fragments, this notebook focuses on incorporating these concepts into the graph as a new type of node: concept nodes, each representing one of the detected legal terms. These nodes are connected via edges to all text chunk nodes in which the corresponding concept was identified.\n",

    "Additionally, before adding this new node type, the notebook includes a code section dedicated to pruning all sequence nodes of type PUB. Sequence nodes in the \"Sequence\" table of the DOCLEG database can be of two types: PUB and VIG, indicating whether the sequence captures the text at the moment of its publication (PUB) or at the time it entered into force (VIG) as well as the date when this happenned. During the hackathon, the RIZIV team expressed a preference for keeping only VIG sequences in order to simplify the prototype Q&A system."
